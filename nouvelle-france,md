🧠 Creative Insights
💡 Tactic	📚 Use it for...
👑 No democracy	Stories should show petition, not vote
⚖️ Three-way tension	Intendant vs Governor vs Bishop = drama
🏘️ Decentralized power	Local priests & seigneurs wield influence
🪶 Native diplomacy is vital	Gift-giving, negotiation, betrayal all in play

📜 Final Note
“New France was never meant to become France—it was meant to defend her interests, her Church, and her King, on borrowed time and foreign soil.”
